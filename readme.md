# FILMUNITY
Filmunity is a social network in correlation with movies and tv series. Namely, users have the ability to keep up with the film achievements and share their impressions with friends in a simple and fun way.
Using Filmunity, it is possible to quickly and easily search for movies and tv
series, rate them and create so-called watchlists and at the same time be in touch with
friends, all of that thanks to the modern technologies used in the application development
process.
